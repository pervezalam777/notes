# Clean Code
Why the bad code get written?

Sometimes you just trying to complete the task on time and you knows that is not the best work, but it is running and you are relieved. A working mess is better than nothing. right? you tell yourself you'll clean it up later but 'later' never comes.

## The Element of clean code
- `Clean code is focused`: In a piece of cleanly written code, each class, method, and function are separate and undisturbed by one another. Every object fulfills a single purpose that is entirely encapsulated in its class and all services are narrowly aligned with that purpose.

- `Clean code is non-redundant`: Clean code complies with the DRY rule (Don't repeat yourself). When the DRY is successfully applied throughout a piece of code, modifications of single elements are simple and do not require changes to logically unrelated items.

- `Clean code is pleasant`: Looking through clean code is like reading a well authored reference book -- it's easy to follow and simple to find what you're looking for. This ease comes from following popular programming principles like KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need it).

- `Clean code is Easily Extended`: Clean code is written with other developers in mind. The programmer knows that they might not be the maintainer, so the ensure the code is an easy map to follow from future developers

- `Clean code has minimal dependencies`: The minimal dependencies in clean code make it easier to maintain. Classes and methods are short and the code itself is well divided. Clean divisions make reading the code straightforward and simple.

- `Clean code has unit and acceptance tests`: Clean code is tested to ensure it complies with requirements. Being tested means that the code can be maintained and extended without the fear of breaking it.

- `Clean code is expressive`: Clean code has meaningful names that are distinct and express their intensions. This expressiveness makes the code itself a document, which makes the need for separate document less important.

- `Clean code is well thought out`: There are not confusing workarounds in clean code. Developers spend time finding good solutions that keep the language simple and easy to follow.
