# Dependency Inversion Principle

## conclusion
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Detains should depend on abstractions.
- Avoid a source code dependencies from the business logic to he database using the dependency inversion technique.
