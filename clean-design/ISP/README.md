# Interface Segregation Principle


## Conclusion
- No client should be provided an interface with functionality it does not use.
- For languages that do not have interfaces: Subtypes should not be forced to inherit or implement methods that have specific semantic, signature.
- Interfaces should describe groups of operations that logically belong together.
- The ISP makes it easier to mock interfaces in unit tests, reuse them throughout your code, and understand the logic behind the design.
