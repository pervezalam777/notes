# Open Close Principle (OCP)
Open for change and close for modification.

## In order to achieve clean design 
- Create an abstraction or use a design pattern(plugin, strategy, or template) to achieve the OCP
- Apply TDD to maintain a balance between over-design the required abstraction for the OCP
- Remember that you will never achieve the OCP completely; you must apply it strategically.
