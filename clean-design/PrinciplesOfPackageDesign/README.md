# Principles of Package Design

## Cohesion Principles
### The Common Closure Principle
### The Common Reuse Principle
### The Reuse/Release Equivalence Principle

## Coupling Principles
### Acyclic Dependencies Principle
### Stable Dependencies Principle
### Stable Abstraction Principle

## Conclusion
- Principles of cohesion help you develop modules with high cohesion
- High cohesion results in easier maintenance, less frequent change, and more reusability.
- Principles of coupling help you develop architecture with loose coupling
- Loose coupling results in code that is more changeable, easier to work with and more flexible.
