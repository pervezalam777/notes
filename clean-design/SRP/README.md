# Single Responsibility Principle


## Conclusion
To prevent you code from getting messy, remember the following guidelines
- A class should be small, and it should have only one reason to change.
- The source of any axis of change is a user or an actor
- High cohesion is a helpful additional method to identify violations of SRP.
- Mixing responsibilities leads to a fragile and highly coupled system.
