# Strategies of Package Design

## Package by layer
## Package by feature
## Team Organization: Conway's law

## Conclusion
- Package by layer by grouping classes in modules by layers (e.g:  ui, data, service, etc.)
- Package by feature by placing all items related to a single feature in a single module
- Remember that your team structure will impact your application's structure.
- Be mindful of technical factors and the constant process of clean design to avoid rot over time.
