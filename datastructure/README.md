# Data Structure
`A data structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.`

## **`Abstract data type`**
An abstract data type (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provide only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.

The interface dow not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.

| Abstraction (ADT) | Implementation (DS)                                                       |
| ------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `List`            | Dynamic Array, <br />Linked list                                          |
| `Queue`           | Linked List based Queue, <br />Stake based Queue, <br/>array based queue  |
| `Map`             | Tree Map, <br/> Hash Map / Hash Table                                     |
| `Vehicle`         | Golf Cart, Car, Bike, etc.                                                |

## **`Complexity Analysis`**
- `Time Complexity`: How much time does an algorithm need to finish?
- `Space Complexity`: How much space does an algorithm need for its computation?


## **`Big--O Notation`**
`Big--O` Notation gives an `upper bound` of the complexity in the `worst case`, helping to `quantify performance` as the input `size becomes arbitrarily larger`.

- Constant Time: `O(1)`
- Logarithmic Time: `O(log(n))`
- Learn Time: `O(n)`
- Linearithmic Time: `O(nlog(n))`
- Quadric Time: `O(n^2)`
- Cubic Time: `O(n^3)`
- Exponential Time: `O(b^n)`, b > 1
- Factorial Time: `O(n!)`
