## React Native WebView GIT issues

### [1 thirdPartyCookiesEnabled on iOS #486](https://github.com/react-native-webview/react-native-webview/issues/486)  

My particular problem is that it is impossible to embed a twitter video inside a Webview unless all third party cookies have been accepted.

The prop thirdPartyCookiesEnabled is for android only and it states in documentation that iOS should enable the third party cookies by default.
