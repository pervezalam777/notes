### Hashing 
Hashing always generate same output based on the same input but it never provide a way to progressive password detection. Single character changed in password generates totally different hash which does not have any similarity with respect to same characters. 


### Dictionary attack
It contains dictionary of common passwords (e.g. "123456789", "qwerty" etc.)
